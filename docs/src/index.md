# MolecularFingerprints

Welcome to the documentation for [MolecularFingerprints.jl](https://github.com/LukaszSztukiewicz/MolecularFingerprints.jl), a Julia package for calculating molecular fingerprints.

If you are coming from a computer science background, you are likely used to thinking about data in terms of arrays, hashes, or objects. In chemoinformatics, our primary challenge is representing a real chemical molecule in a format that a computer can actually work with efficiently.
